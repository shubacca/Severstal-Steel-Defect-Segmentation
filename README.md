# Springboard Capstone Project 2: Severstal Steel Defect Image Segmentation 
The current project analyzes steel images obtained from Severstal databases, and we are trying to develop a deep learning image segmentation model to correctly identify 4 types of defects on the images. Identifying different types of steel sheet defects is critical to improving the company's and industry's automation, increasing efficiency, and maintaining high quality in production.

A Vanilla U-Net model has been used for the image segmentations task. Details on the report can be found <a href='https://github.com/shubacca/Severstal-Steel-Defect-Segmentation/blob/master/Deliverables/Milestone%20Report%202.pdf'> here. </a>
